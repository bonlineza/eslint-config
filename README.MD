# B-Online's Eslint Configuration
This eslint configuration file represents the collection of years worth of development using React.js and the coding rules/style we have decided to implement are recorded in these rules.

## Usage
- install package with: `yarn add @bonlineza/eslint-config`
- in your `.eslintrc` file - add it to the 'extends' key:
```JSON
{
  "extends": ["@bonlineza"],
}
```
